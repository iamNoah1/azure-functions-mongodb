* Using [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools) to start function. Therefore change to BookReadingRepository directory and simply run `func start`.


# Run Integration Tests

* Start Functions either through Visual Studio or from CLI.
* Through Visual Studio, use the context menue of the BookReadingRepositoryIntegrationTest project to run test.
